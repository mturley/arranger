Arranger is a score editor for lilypond.

Goals:
  Fast turn around between note entry and a visual product
    This will be achieved by storing scores as a collection of fragments that
    can be individually generated while working on a project, providing for
    more immediate feedback on whether or not lilypond input is correct.
  Organization
    Arranger will represent scores internally (to a degree). By taking
    organization of scores out of the hands of the user, they can focus on the
    more important subject of actually writing the score. Perhaps this could be
    customized at some point but thats not really a goal at the moment.

Representation of an Arranger project:

  Scores contain staves contain voices.
  Voices are a mixture of phrases and content.

TODO:
  - improve code documentation
      it is my belief that code should document itself, but a standard would be
      nice and class definitions never hurt anybody
  - unit tests
      google has a nice unit test framework...
  - ui
      none of the ui is written yet
  - internal score representation
  - pdf viewer
  - phrase list widget
  - save and export scores
  - import scores
  - a lot of other things
